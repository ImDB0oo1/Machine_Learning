# Income Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict income levels based on various demographic and socioeconomic features. The model uses the [Adult dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult), which contains census data, to classify individuals into two income categories: `<=50K` and `>50K`.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Feature engineering and selection
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms

## Data Processing

- Handling missing values
- Feature encoding and binning
- Normalization using `StandardScaler`

## Visualizations

- Distribution of target variable (`income`)
- Feature distributions (e.g., education, marital status, age)
- PCA components in 2D and 3D plots

## Machine Learning Models

The project explores various algorithms, including:

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
